# Example demonstrating the use of UART Adapter abstraction layer

## Overview

This application demonstrates the use of all the ADC adapter using the GPADC.
## HW and SW configuration

- **Hardware configuration**

  - This example runs on The DA14695 Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
  - The Pro Development kit is needed for this example.
  - Connect the Development kit to the host computer.

- **Software configuration**

  - This example requires:

  - SmartSnippets Studio 2.0.16 or newer
  - SDK10.0.10.118

  - **SEGGER J-Link** SEGGER tools are normally downloaded and installed as part of the Smart Snippets Studio installation.

## How to run the example

- Import the example in your workspace
