ht -> tgt: getsuouartbuffsz
tgt -> ht: OK 4096
note left
This is the size of the DA1469x command buffer.
It dictates how much code we can transfer at
one time
end note

ht -> tgt: alloc 2048
note left
alloc instructs the DA1469x to allocate a working buffer.
Note for each nibble of firmware we transfer, one byte
is sent to to the DA1469x in ASCII format. A 
buffer of 4096 returned by getsuouartbuffsz means
we can send 2048 bytes of code at a time.
end note
tgt -> ht: OK

ht -> tgt: fwupdate
note left
Note commands prior to fwupdate are echoed back to the host,
though they are not depicted. This allows the DA1469x to
act as a CLI. Commands are not echoed once the firware 
update process is started (e.g. after the fwupdate command
is received).

note left
Indicate the image is to be stored in flash
end note
tgt -> ht: INFO SUOUART_IMG_STARTED OK

ht -> tgt: SUOUART_PATCH_LEN 0 2 0008
note left
0008 is litte endian --> 0x0800 = 2048
This instructs the DA1469x to confirm when 
this many bytes have been received and is used
as a flow control mechanism
end note
tgt -> ht: OK

ht -> tgt: SUOUART_PATCH_DATA 0 2048 <2048 Bytes of data>
note left
Transfer a block of code. The DA1469x confirms it was 
received without issue.
end note
tgt -> ht: INFO SUOUART_CMP_OK

== Keep sending blocks of 2048 until less than 2048 bytes left to send ==

ht -> tgt: SUOUART_PATCH_LEN 0 2 3404
note left
Here we need to transfer the remainder of the
image, but the final block is less than 2048 bytes.
We adjust the PATCH_LEN so the DA1469x will inform
us when the remainder has been processed. 
3404 --> 0x0434 = 1076 bytes remaining to transfer
end note
tgt -> ht: OK

ht -> tgt: SUOUART_PATCH_DATA 0 1076 <1076 Bytes of data>

Transfer the final block
end note

Confirm the size of the image we transferred
end note

Indicate to the DA1469x the image transfer is complete
end note

note left
Instruct the DA1469x to reset. Once it does, the new image
will run.
